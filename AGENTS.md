# Agent workflow

Every task moves through the same four beats, each backed by a skill from
this collection (or installed alongside it — see [Skill sources](#skill-sources)).
Drop this file into a repo as `AGENTS.md` and fill in the repo-specific
callouts; it also governs work in this repo itself.

## Workflow

1. **Isolate — `/new-feature`.** Every new feature starts in a fresh Git
   worktree branched from `origin/main` so agents can work in parallel
   without conflicts. Never build on `main`.
2. **Build — `/code-structure`.** Write code to the service-layer
   architecture: actions/boundaries orchestrate the "why/when", a service
   layer owns the reusable "how", with explicit inputs and structured
   returns.
3. **Prove — `/evidence-driven-testing`.** Verify with the repo's checks
   plus runtime evidence. Capture the **before** state while reproducing the
   issue — prior to fixing it, when it is cheapest — and the **after** once
   the change works.
4. **Ship — `/before-and-after`, then `/greploop`.** Open the PR with
   before/after proof embedded in the description (screenshot or video
   whenever the change has a visible surface; measured numbers or output
   pairs when it doesn't). Run `/greploop` — or `/greploop-apps` when the PR
   exceeds Greptile's file-count limit — until Greptile reports **5/5 with
   zero unresolved comments**. Finish by presenting the PR URL.

## Structured judgment checkpoints

When the project enables `/jev-gate`, add scoped audits at the boundaries below.
Keep the four workflow beats and their existing requirements. Start in shadow
mode; adopt enforcement only after the project calibrates the question set.

| Boundary | Jev phase | Keep outside Jev |
|---|---|---|
| Scope check, before implementation | `intake` | Worktree creation, branch identity, exact overlap checks |
| Shared-service extraction review | `architecture` | Type checks, dependency rules, auth enforcement |
| Before running planned tests | `test-plan` | Test execution and measured coverage |
| After collecting before/after proof | `evidence` | Actual media inspection and runtime verification |
| Greptile finding/fix review | `review` | Reviewer identity, review freshness, thread resolution |
| Before claiming completion | `ship` | CI results, Greptile gate, shipping authorization |
| After editing human-facing text | `prose` | Writing and factual source verification |
| Trust-boundary or irreversible changes | `risk` | Security controls and human authorization |

Read [jev-gate/SKILL.md](jev-gate/SKILL.md) for manifest preparation and result
handling. Send primary text excerpts, not the whole repo. In enforce mode, a
missing, stale, uncertain, blocked, or unavailable judgment stops that checkpoint.
A shadow or replay observation never counts as an enforced pass. Every enabled
checkpoint must cover its reviewed inventory of applicable units; a favorable
sample is not a whole-change judgment.

The project must record the applicable stages, required deterministic checks,
unit inventory, and adoption mode. This template does not silently enable external
calls or install a hosted CI gate. The CLI uses Git revision bindings; Perforce
keeps manual advisory use until a shelf-digest adapter exists.

Jev supplements Greptile's 5/5 and zero-unresolved requirement. It cannot resolve
threads, waive findings, pass failed tests, or authorize a push, publish, or merge.
When the user requests local-only work, keep the implementation and evidence local
and report that hosted review was not run.

Ship-beat notes:

- `/before-and-after` drives the `@vercel/before-and-after` CLI. `--markdown`
  uploads the pair and prints a PR-ready table; it also accepts existing
  PNGs, so evidence gathered while developing can be reused as-is.
- In containers/VMs where Chrome fails with "No usable sandbox", set
  `AGENT_BROWSER_ARGS="--no-sandbox"` for the capture command.
- The default upload host (0x0.st) is public — fine for ordinary UI shots;
  pass `--upload-url` for anything sensitive.

## Writing for humans

Run `/unslop` over anything a person will read, before you commit, post, or
send it: commit messages, the PR title and body, README and doc edits, code
comments, and the closing reply. It strips AI tells (em dashes, filler,
hedging, chatbot phrases, puffery, bold-label lists) and replaces fancy
words with plain ones and passive voice with active. Apply it to text you
wrote or changed, not to prose you didn't touch.

## Multi-agent rules

- Never commit directly to `main`.
- One worktree and one branch per task and per agent — never reuse or modify
  another agent's worktree, branch, or uncommitted work.
- **Scope check** before starting: skim open PRs' changed files
  (`gh pr list`, `gh pr diff <n> --name-only`) and look for uncommitted work
  in shared checkouts. On overlap, stop and ask for direction.
- Never force-push to `main` — and never plain `--force` anywhere; only
  `--force-with-lease`, only on your own task branch.
- Resolve lockfile conflicts by regenerating, never by hand-merging.
- Worktrees don't isolate shared resources: confirm a dev-server port
  answers *your* process before trusting it, and don't run schema
  experiments against a shared database.
- If a conflict can't be resolved confidently, stop and report instead of
  guessing.

## Completing a task

1. Keep changes limited to the assigned task.
2. Run the repo's checks *(repo-specific: list the exact commands here)*.
3. Assemble the evidence captured along the way into before/after pairs.
4. Commit with a clear message, rebase onto the latest `origin/main`, and
   rerun the checks.
5. Push (`git push -u origin <branch>`; after rebasing an already-pushed
   branch, `--force-with-lease`).
6. Open the PR. The body must explain what changed, how it was tested (every
   claim backed by evidence), before/after proof, and any risks or follow-up
   work. Run the title and body through `/unslop` before posting.
7. Run `/greploop` (or `/greploop-apps`) until **5/5 with zero unresolved
   comments**.
8. End by presenting the PR URL.

Do not merge the PR unless explicitly instructed. Keep the worktree until
the PR is merged or closed.

## Repo-specific sections to add

When dropping this file into a project, append what agents need to execute
the beats there: commands & checks, hard invariants (security and
architecture rules), an environment quick reference, local test
infrastructure (stubs, fixtures), and anything that can't be tested locally.

| `greploop` | this repo, vendored from [greptileai/skills](https://github.com/greptileai/skills) |
| `greploop-apps` | this repo (local variant of greploop for huge PRs; no separate upstream) |
| `unslop` | this repo, vendored from [cursor/plugins (pstack)](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/skills/unslop); frontmatter edited so agents apply it unprompted (`disable-model-invocation` dropped, description scoped to text the agent writes or edits for people), original body retained with a local optional Jev fidelity-audit section |
