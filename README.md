# Skills

A collection of [agent skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) for Claude Code. Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (name, description) and instructions that Claude loads on demand when the task matches.

## Jev judgment integration

[jev-gate](jev-gate/SKILL.md) adds scoped TypeSafe Jev audits to the existing
workflow. It includes 25 atomic questions, strict context manifests, bounded API
calls, typed decision reports, and offline tests. Worktrees, service-layer design,
recorded evidence, before/after proof, and Greptile remain in place.

Read the [repo audit](docs/jev-audit.md) for every candidate insertion point and
what was deliberately left alone. The [question map](jev-gate/references/question-map.md)
and [operation guide](jev-gate/references/operation.md) cover setup and adoption.
The default is shadow mode; live calls require a TypeSafe key and a reviewed plan.
There is no automatic merge, push, upload, or review-thread resolution.

TypeSafe documents a 64k-token request limit and a separate 32k-token
state-plus-longest-question limit. This implementation pins `jev-1.13.0` and
uses conservative byte caps, not a purported exact tokenizer. See
[verified capabilities](jev-gate/references/capabilities.md) and
[context controls](jev-gate/references/context.md).

Run the offline integration checks after installing `jev-gate/requirements.txt`
and pytest in a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_jev_gate.py -q
python jev-gate/examples/demo.py --out .artifacts/jev-demo
```

## Available skills

### [before-and-after](before-and-after/SKILL.md)

Captures before/after screenshots of web pages or elements and outputs a PR-ready markdown comparison table. It drives the `@vercel/before-and-after` CLI.

Use it when:

- A PR needs visual proof that a UI change does what it claims
- You want a `| Before | After |` table generated and uploaded in one step
- Comparing two URLs, two existing images, or a mix of both

> Vendored from [vercel-labs/before-and-after](https://github.com/vercel-labs/before-and-after) (PolyForm Shield 1.0.0, license included in the folder). Install the CLI with `npm i -g @vercel/before-and-after agent-browser`.

### [code-structure](code-structure/SKILL.md)

Service layer architecture guidance. Enforces a two-layer separation where **actions** orchestrate domain rules (the "why/when") and a **service layer** centralizes reusable operational mechanics (the "how").

Use it when:

- Multiple workflows duplicate the same operational logic
- You're deciding what belongs in actions vs. shared services
- A bug fix in one flow doesn't propagate to others doing the same thing
- Adding a feature that shares mechanics with existing ones

Includes a migration checklist for extracting shared logic safely and a table of anti-patterns to avoid (god services, leaky services, over-abstraction).

### [evidence-driven-testing](evidence-driven-testing/SKILL.md)

Records visual proof while testing UI behavior. The agent drives the app live via computer use (or [cua-driver](https://github.com/trycua/cua) when the harness has no computer-use tools) while the bundled recorder captures the session, then posts the video and a results summary to the PR and tracker issue. The recorder (`scripts/evidence.py`, Python 3 + FFmpeg) runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows and has `doctor`, `start`, `annotate`, and `stop` commands. It timestamps each annotation as the agent tests, burns them into `evidence.mp4` on stop, and summarizes them in a generated `report.md` and `manifest.json`. Headless environments swap the recorder for scripted screenshots and Playwright captures; non-UI changes still get evidence (measured numbers, output pairs, transcript excerpts).

Use it whenever a change needs verifiable evidence that it works, instead of prose claims.

> The recorder needs `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` built with `libx264` and the `ass` filter, plus a screen-capture source: X11 (`DISPLAY`) or wlroots Wayland (`wf-recorder`; GNOME/KDE are not supported) on Linux, Screen Recording permission on macOS, any standard ffmpeg on Windows. `python3 scripts/evidence.py doctor` reports both. The raw capture is MPEG-TS, so a crashed or hard-killed recorder still yields usable evidence. The headless path needs only a running app and a scriptable browser (Playwright via npx). Posting evidence requires the `gh` CLI (or equivalent). `tests/test_evidence.py` smoke-tests the recorder end to end with a synthetic video source (`python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`).

### [greploop](greploop/SKILL.md)

Iteratively fixes a PR (GitHub), MR (GitLab), or shelved changelist (Perforce) until Greptile gives a perfect review: 5/5 confidence with zero unresolved comments. Triggers the review, fixes actionable comments, resolves threads, pushes, and repeats, up to `--max-iterations` cycles (default 10).

Use it to get a PR to a clean Greptile review before merge.

> Vendored from [greptileai/skills](https://github.com/greptileai/skills) (MIT, license included in the folder). Requires Greptile installed on the repo and an authenticated `gh`/`glab`/`p4` CLI.

### [greploop-apps](greploop-apps/SKILL.md)

The same loop as greploop, but it triggers reviews by tagging `@greptile-apps`, which bypasses Greptile's file-count limit on huge PRs that the plain `@greptile` mention refuses to review. When no check run appears, it falls back to polling Greptile's edited summary comment.

Use it when greploop's trigger gets "Too many files changed for review".

> Local variant derived from greptileai's greploop (MIT, license included in the folder); no separate upstream.

### [new-feature](new-feature/SKILL.md)

Starts every new task in an isolated Git worktree branched from `origin/main` so multiple agents can work on the same repo in parallel without conflicts. It covers unique task naming, a scope check against open PRs, fresh dependency installs, and cleanup after merge.

Use it when:

- Starting any new feature, fix, or task, before writing code
- Multiple agents (or sessions) work the same repository concurrently
- You need a consistent branch-per-task convention with safe cleanup

Includes harness deltas for Claude Code and Cursor, which manage worktrees themselves.

### [unslop](unslop/SKILL.md)

Edits prose to remove AI tells and put a human voice back in. It names 31 patterns to catch (puffery, filler, hedging, chatbot phrases, em dashes, colons as connectors, bold and emoji overuse, abstract metaphor nouns, passive voice) and a short checklist for adding opinion and rhythm, applied as a four-step loop: scan, rewrite, add soul, self-audit.

Use it when:

- Writing anything a person will read: commit messages, PR titles and bodies, docs, README edits, code comments, chat replies
- Cleaning up existing text that reads machine-made

> Vendored from [cursor/plugins (pstack)](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/skills/unslop) (MIT, license included in the folder). The original body is retained, with a local optional Jev fidelity-audit section appended; the frontmatter has two edits so agents apply the skill on their own instead of waiting for a typed `/unslop`. We dropped the `disable-model-invocation: true` line, and the description now names the trigger (text you write or edit for a human reader) in place of upstream's "any writing. Must always apply.", so auto-invocation matches the scope `AGENTS.md` gives it. Restore the flag if you want slash-command-only behavior.

## Workflow

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) ties the skills together into a four-beat workflow: isolate (`new-feature`) → build (`code-structure`) → prove (`evidence-driven-testing`) → ship (`before-and-after` + `greploop`), with `unslop` applied to everything written for humans along the way. Drop it into a repo alongside the skills and fill in the repo-specific callouts (checks, invariants, environment).

## Installation

For this local Jev addition, copy the complete `jev-gate/` folder alongside the other skills in your agent's project skill directory. Its scripts and schemas must stay together. The upstream install command below installs upstream contents, not this unpushed local branch.

Use `npx skills` to install the upstream skills to most coding agents:

```bash
npx skills add michaelshimeles/skills
```

Claude Code picks up the skill automatically and invokes it when a task matches the skill's description. You can also invoke one explicitly with `/code-structure` or `/evidence-driven-testing`.

## Adding a new skill

1. Create a folder named after the skill (kebab-case).
2. Add a `SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter. The description is what Claude uses to decide when the skill applies, so make it trigger-focused ("Use when...").
3. Keep instructions concise and actionable; link out to reference files in the folder if they get long.
